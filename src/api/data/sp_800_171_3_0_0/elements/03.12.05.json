Organizations consider the risks related to new or increased threats that may be introduced when systems exchange information with other systems that may have different security requirements or policies. The types of agreements selected are based on factors such as the relationship between the organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, business to business, government to business, government or business, or government or business to individual) and the level of access to the organizational system by users of the other system. The types of agreements can include information exchange security agreements, interconnection security agreements, memoranda of understanding or agreement, service-level agreements, or other types of agreements. Organizations may incorporate agreement information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established between federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (e.g., service providers, contractors, system developers, and system integrators). The types of information contained in exchange agreements include the interface characteristics, security requirements, controls, and responsibilities for each system."
