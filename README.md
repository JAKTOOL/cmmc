# CMMC

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> CMMC currently uses NIST 800-171 Rev 2. If you want to get ahead of eventual compliance using Rev 3, then this application is for you. NIST provides a [change analysis](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/final/docs/sp800-171r2-to-r3-analysis.xlsx) for what's different.

It was challenging to find resources for [NIST 800-171 Revision 3](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-3/final) and [CMMC](https://dodcio.defense.gov/cmmc/About/) compliance, so this application was created to make writing SSP's a bit easier, without having to stare at an excel spreadsheet.

By going through the 800-171 controls, you can generate a markdown file with all statuses and notes for each security control. Withdrawn controls from revision 2 are included, so as to meet all requirements for CMMC.

## Features

- Stores data client-side using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
- Generates a markdown file for compliance (Good for System Security Plan!)
- Generates a POAM in CSV for unimplemented requirements
- Allows for exporting and importing the database for archived storage
- Offline usage with PWA and Service Workers

## Usage

1. Go to [CMMC app](https://cmmc.jaktool.com/)
2. Start working through security controls for a family
3. Choose whether it has been implemented or not, and any notes
4. Click the upper right menu
5. Click `Generate Report` to download a markdown document
6. Click `Generate POAM` to download a CSV for gap items

### Icon Meanings

- 🟢 A family, requirement, or security requirement is implemented.
- 🔴 A family, requirement, or security requirement is not implemented.
- ⚫ A family, requirement, or security requirement is not applicable.
- ⚪ A family, requirement, or security requirement has not been started (default).
- 🟡 A family or requirement is partially implemented (some security requirements are implemented and not implemented)
- 🚧 A family or requirement has remaining work.

## Privacy

All data is stored locally on your device using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). There are no privacy concerns, as there are no 3rd party tracking, analytic, or external servers used to for this application.
