# NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3

I built this because it was challenging to find resources for NIST 800-171 Revision 3 without paying a bunch of money for [CMMC](https://dodcio.defense.gov/cmmc/About/) compliance.

By going through the 800-171 controls, you can generate a markdown file with all statuses and notes for each security control. Withdrawn controls are filtered out from the revision 2 -> revision 3 migration.

## Features

- Stores data client-side using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), ensuring no privacy concerns
- Generates a markdown file for compliance (Good for System Security Plan!)

## Usage

1. Go to [nist-sp-800-171](https://nist-sp-800-171.neal.codes/)
2. Start working through security controls for a family
3. Choose whether it has been implemented or not, and any notes
4. Click `Generate Markdown` to download a markdown document whenever

### Icon Meanings

- ðŸŸ¢ All requirements or security requirements have been implemented (or are not applicable).
- ðŸ”´ Any security requirement within a family or requirement has not been implemented.
- âš« A family, requirement, or security requirement is not applicable.

## Privacy

All data is stored locally on your device using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). There are no privacy concerns, as no data is sent to any server.

## Resources

For more information on NIST 800-171 Revision 3, you can refer to the official document [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-3/final).

JSON used for the application from [csrc.nist.gov](https://csrc.nist.gov/extensions/nudp/services/json/nudp/framework/version/sp_800_171_3_0_0/export/json?element=all).

[CMMC COA](https://cmmc-coa.com/) is a great resource as well for CMMC.

Made the app in a couple days... don't expect the best code.
