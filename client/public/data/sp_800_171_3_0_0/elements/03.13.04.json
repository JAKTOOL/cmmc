Information in shared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, the control of information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence, which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted, covert channels (including storage and timing channels) in which shared system resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions, or components within systems for which there are only single users or roles."
